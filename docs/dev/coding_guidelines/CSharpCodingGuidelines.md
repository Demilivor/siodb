# Siodb Java Coding Guidelines

## 0. Introduction

This document lists requirements to C# code. Many of them are based on established standards
collected from a number of sources, individual experience, local requirements/needs.

Code readability must be taken as first priority. Given that, code efficincy must be achieved
mostly by using proper data structures, algorithms, standard functions and classes.

While a given development environment (IDE) can improve the readability of code by access
visibility, color coding, automatic formatting and so on, the programmer should never rely on such
features. Source code should always be considered larger than the IDE it is developed within and
should be written in a way that maximise its readability independent of any IDE.

## 1. General Rules

**Rule 1.1** All C# code must use C# 7 syntax. Avoid intentionally writing more
complicated code than mentioned above standard allows that is compatible with
earlier C# specifications.
