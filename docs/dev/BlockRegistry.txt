BLOCK REGISTRY
=================

1. OVERVIEW

Block registry consists of data set of data files, that contains header and
data records.


2. BLOCK LIST DATA FILE

Header (12 bytes):
uint64_t fileId              // Data file ID (starts from 1)
uint32_t nextDataPosition    // File position for a next new data

Data record (29 bytes):
uint8_t  blockState                     // State of the block
uint64_t prevBlockId                    // Previous block, 0 means no previous block
uint64_t nextBlockId                    // First "next" block file ID,
                                        // 0 means no next block
uint64_t nextNextBlockListFileId        // Next "next" block file ID location:
                                        // data file ID, 0 means no next record
uint32_t nextNextBlockListFileOffset    // Next "next" block file ID location
                                        // data offset ID

Single block list data file size is 10M, which stores up to 361577 records.


3. NEXT BLOCK LIST DATA FILE

Header (12 bytes used):
uint64_t fileID            // File identifier
uint32_t nextDataOffset    // File position for a next new data

Data record (20 bytes):
uint64_t nextBlockId                    // First "next" block file ID
uint64_t nextNextBlockListFileId        // Next "next" block file ID location:
                                        // data file ID, 0 means no next record
uint32_t nextNextBlockListFileOffset    // Next "next" block file ID location
                                        // data offset ID

Single next block list data file size is 10M, which stores up to 524287 records.
