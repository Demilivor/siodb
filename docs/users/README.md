# User documentation

We write the user documentation in Markdown. Then you can build the user documentation with [mkdocs](https://www.mkdocs.org).

## How to install mkdocs?

- https://www.mkdocs.org/#installation

## How to preview the user documentation?

Then you can view the result of your change before committing with `mkdocs`.
For instance, that will launch a web server to preview your site as you work:

```bash
cd docs/users
mkdocs serve
```
